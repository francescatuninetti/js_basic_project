This webpage runs a simple counter to increase or decrease a number. 

## :question: Why
This project is the final practice for start2impact Javascript Basic course.<br>
Created in the August 2022, this is my first JS project.

User interface is very simple, you can increase, decrease the number in the box by one with + and - buttons. To reset the number to 0, click on "Reset" button:
